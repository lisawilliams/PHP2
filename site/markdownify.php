my virginity in 1991, 10 years after the CDC published news of the
emergence of an epidemic among gay men in New York and California, but
before effective treatments for HIV/AIDS were developed.

We were all having sex at Checkpoint Charlie back then: "Show me your
paperzzz."  There were no rapid HIV tests then, either, so a visit to
the clinic to get your blood drawn followed by a two week wait tended to
slow down courtship rituals significantly in my circle.

The atmosphere of fear and doubt cannot be underestimated: nobody seemed
to know what was going on, but they knew it was bad and would kill you,
but not before making you a pariah and a moral object lesson.  It was a
sex panic of the first order: because unlike previous sex panics, it was
about something real, and it really did kill people.  (The great heroes
of this dark era are, of course,  <a

The author of "<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Devil-Made-Me-Do/dp/0615199070">The
Devil Made Me Do It</a>," Georgina Spelvin, starred in the
groundbreaking and much-imitated porn movie "<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Devil-Miss-Jones-35th-Anniversary/dp/
B001JA2W74/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335629176&amp;sr=8-1">The Devil
and Miss Jones</a>." When I read books like this engaging memoir of
Spelvin\'s sexual career, both private and public, it seems almost like
science fiction to me: a completely different world, with completely
different rules, one that I\'ll never be able to see or visit.

The people in this book are so carefree with their sexuality!  I have an
actual on-paper copy of this book, which I picked up at <a
href="http://www.goodvibes.com/">Good Vibrations</a> in Brookline, but
there\'s a Kindle edition now, and I\'m tempted to buy it so I can use the
search feature: it\'s possible that the word "condom" is mentioned in
this book, but if it is, I missed it.  (Spelvin does, however, mention
Adult Industry Medical (AIM), which administered the testing regime for
most porn performers in the US <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20101016193546/http://latimesblogs.
latimes.com/lanow/2010/10/wicked-pictures-suspends-production-as-
precaution-following-new-hiv-case-in-porn-performer-.html">until
collapsing in scandal in 2010</a>, late in the book, but that takes
place well after she has departed from the industry).

While the dalliances of Ms. Spelvin and her friends seem carefree from
the perspective of those of us whose sex lives started in the HIV era,
that doesn\'t mean that they were in any way cavalier; Georgina leads
with her heart, has many crushes, a few divorces, and gets her heart
broken on several occasions.  This is a wonderful corrective: I think
the current sexual climate has given many people a warped view -- they
think that those freewheeling free-love types must not have cared about
each other very much.  Ain\'t necessarily so.

Spelvin takes us through the rustic setting of the porn industry in
those days, well before it had become the big, industrial megaplex it is
today.  She describes seeing the set where The Devil In Miss Jones is
filmed: <blockquote>Late in the afternoon we pull up before a looming
nineteenth-century barn-like structure. It stands in majestic isolation
on a slight knoll.  The last quarter of our trip had been through
towering trees sporting vivid fall colors.  The only sign of
civilization seen for a half-hour or more, a small roadhouse tucked in
among the abundant foliage.  Now before us an expansive field of long
amber grass stretches to thick woods on three sides.</blockquote> If
that\'s not rustic enough, when Georgina and the crew get inside, they
are jubilant to find... <blockquote>"Hallelujah!" I explode. "There is a
God.  I found a hot water heater.  Anyone know how to light this
thing?"</blockquote> Ms. Spelvin is not only the star of these early
productions -- she\'s also in charge of craft services.  That\'s $100 a
day to perform, and another $25 to cook.

You really have to respect someone who can star in a porn movie and then
feed her fellow performers and crew a standing rib roast, as Spelvin
does on the set, having snagged food for the entire crew for $56 at
wholesalers in her New York City neighborhood.

Of course, being in the porn industry (then or now) doesn\'t offer a lot
of job security.  Spelvin goes on to do musical theater, and encounters
the perils of being a sexual outlaw in her era -- perils that aren\'t
medical, but legal:

<blockquote>Two men in suits -- nobody wears suits in the summer in
Maine -- are walking slowly down the aisle [of the theater] looking very
uncomfortable... "Are you Georgina Spelvin?" asks the taller of the two
Suits. "On occasion," I reply -- not meaning to be sarcastic, just
accurate. "We are here to serve you with a fugitive warrant for your
arrest."</blockquote> The ensuing scene -- where the play\'s producer
convinces the two FBI agents to keep an eye on Ms. Spelvin from the
audience and take her into custody *after* the show -- is priceless.  
The warrant turns out to be a witness warrant served by a state\'s
attorney who apparently figures that putting porn stars on the stand
would polish up his credentials as a true-blue moral crusader.  However,
it\'s dropped, and Spelvin never has to testify.

After that point, Spelvin seems adrift, casting from place to place in a
school bus retrofitted with a woodstove (a vehicle that\'s like the
Millenium Falcon in the science fictional universe known as America
between 1950 and the election of Ronald Reagan), alighting at a clothing
optional trailer park in the deserts just outside of San Diego.  Her
relationship with alcohol accelerates into a real problem; she gets
herself sober for jobs that are increasingly more difficult to come by.
 Spelvin never blames the porn industry for her troubles, nor, indeed,
does she seem very troubled by starring in what she and her crowd call
"fuckfilms,"  -- in fact, many of the happiest passages of the book
involve the laughter and camraderie of people on the sets of her movies.

Stripping and live performance is another matter, however, and Spelvin
armors herself with increasingly large amounts of alcohol before
performances.  Her mother shows up to shepherd her through a few final
performances in Atlantic City before taking her home to Texas to dry
out, which she does, after a family friend who shows up at the hospital
after her mother\'s death asks if she wants to attend an AA meeting.

Ms. Spelvin ends up healthy, happy, and living under the Hollywood sign,
bolstered by a long and happy marriage to her husband, John.  While
there were a few points at which I didn\'t quite understand the
transitions in this book -- wait, what year are we in? Oh! It\'s a
flashback -- this is a lovely, comfortable, funny book.  You can find it
-- on paper and as a Kindle book -- at Amazon.
